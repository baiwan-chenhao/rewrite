**The Textbook Learning Stage.**
You will be given some text about one chapter of 仓颉 language programing book or document.
The text will be transformed to note of you by yourself. Notes will be combined to form memory.The memory is used to help
you to write code.
Remember, you are supposed to generate the most essential note due to the limited context length.
In a sentence, the memory, consists of many notes, is used to help you to write code. The note is obtained from textbook
by yourself.
There is the list will be done to memorise the textbook.

Second, find the storage path(its key) of the note.
Third, the note will be stored in that key.
