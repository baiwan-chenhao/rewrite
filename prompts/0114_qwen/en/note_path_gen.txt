There is one note about a new language.You should generate its storage path.
The path may be '基本输入输出', '循环语句', '函数定义', etc.
If an existing path fit the request, just output it. If there is not a fit one, generate a new one.
1. The path you generate should not be an exact fit for a single note, as each path will encompass multiple notes.
2. The length of path should not too long. It is supposed to be resembled the length of a chapter title in a book..
Have generated paths:
<Path>
{{types}}
</Path>
The note to be processed.
<Note>
{{note}}
</Note>
Just choose a existing path or generate a new path, DO NOT generate anything else.
If the note is not valluable to memorize, then reply `NONE`.
